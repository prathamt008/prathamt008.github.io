		<strong>Wildlife photographers</strong> produce images of animals or plants in their natural environments. These portraits often convey a larger picture of life in the wild. In order to do so, wildlife photographers may enhance the photographs or the image through natural or artificial means. From altering the light to utilizing various cameras and lenses, wildlife photographers understand how to produce compelling images through the tools and techniques at their disposal. Finally, wildlife photographers understand how to coax the best images out of a variety of environments and conditions, using equipment that might counteract difficulties or enhance the focus in any natural setting.

        ssWildlife photographers must also understand the importance of designing and displaying the images to best convey the message of their photographs. Photographers may employ digital techniques to enhance their images in print, and they may also work on printing the images on the type of surface that best allows the images captured to appear lifelike and natural. Depending on the type and stock of film used, photographers can develop their own prints or outsource development to a separate company or individual.
